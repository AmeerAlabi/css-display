<p>Apple released the iPhone 15 series on Friday. All four models are now available to purchase online and in stores. Make sure to check out the best iPhone 15 deals and best iPhone 15 Pro deals to secure your new phone at the best possible price. 

    The iPhone 15 lineup marks a transformational change in line with Apple's three-year redesign cycle, as the company introduced a refreshed design that looks and feels noticeably different from the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, and iPhone 14 series. Alongside the latest design, the iPhone 15 series received several noteworthy upgrades, with the iPhone 15 Pro models enjoying the bulk of the enhancements. 
    
    Here's everything you need to know about the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro series, which are set to be some of the best iPhones to date.

        There are four models in the iPhone 15 generation — the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.

        There's no iPhone 15 Mini, like there was with the iPhone 13 generation — Apple discontinued its iPhone Mini model in the iPhone 14 generation.
        
        Likewise, there's no iPhone 15 "Ultra" model with extended upgrades over the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which earlier reports suggested might be announced during Apple's September event.

        <p><h2>iPhone 15: release date</h2>
            <hr> 
            Apple released all four phones in the iPhone 15 series on September 22. The phones are available online and in-store from Apple and carriers like AT&T and Verizon.

            <p><h2>CAMERA</h2>
                <hr>
                <img src="/images/iphone camera.webp" alt="">
                Apple introduced major camera upgrades on all the iPhone 15 models. The main cameras on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are bumped up from 12 megapixels (MP) to 48MP. The new camera offers optical quality (versus inferior digital) 2x zoom by cropping the middle 12MP of the 48MP sensor. That's a meaningful new option in Apple's iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. 

                Photos taken with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are binned from 48MP to 24MP by default, which should add extra detail and clarity. Despite more megapixels, Apple says 24MP photos are still stored at a "practical file size," but we don't yet know how much storage a photo uses, whether it's smaller or larger than 12MP (likely larger). 
                
                The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also have a 48MP main camera that takes 24MP photos, and Apple added popular 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths as preset options.
                
                The iPhone 15 Pro comes with the typical 3x zoom lens, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is furnished with Apple's new 5x zoom lens with a 120mm focal length. The new 5x zoom lens is similar to the periscope-style 10x zoom lens on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, but Apple calls it a "tetraprism" design. 
                
                Later in 2023, Apple will deliver spatial video recording to the iPhone 15 Pro models to capture video in 3D for the Apple Vision Pro AR headset, which is being released "early next year."

                <p><h2>battery life</h2>
                <hr> 
                <img src="/images/iphone 1.webp" alt="">
                Apple spent no time talking about specifics related to battery life for the iPhone 15 generation, as there's no claimed improvement here at all for any of the iPhone 15 models — we can expect similar battery life to the iPhone 14 generation, which was generally excellent. The iPhone 14 Plus especially wowed us and still holds the best result out of any phone in our battery test.

</p>
<p><h2>colors</h2>
    <hr> <hr>
<img src="/images/iphone colors.webp" alt="">
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature Apple's new color-infused back glass with a frosted matte texture available in five color options, including blue, pink, yellow, green, and black.
